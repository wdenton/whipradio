Whip Radio is a little shell script that streams internet radio stations I like.

[[file:whipradio-screenshot.png]]

* Requirements

This requires a Unix-like system.

+ ~bash~ (version 4)
+ ~git~ (to get the code)
+ ~mpv~ (to play the stream)
+ ~whiptail~ (to do the dialog box)

On Ubuntu, this will install what you need (~whiptail~ is built in):

#+begin_src shell
sudo apt install git mpv
#+end_src

On Mac OS X, run this to get ~whiptail~ (requires the [[https://brew.sh/][Homebrew]] package manager):

#+begin_src shell
brew install newt
#+end_src

It will even work on Android, with [[https://termux.com/][Termux]].  Open a shell, then run:

#+begin_src shell
pkg install git dialog mpv
#+end_src

* Installation

This command will download all the files without requiring a GitHub account:

#+begin_src shell
git clone https://github.com/wdenton/whipradio.git
#+end_src

* Usage

Run the script on its own, for example:

#+begin_src shell
./whipradio # If you are in the directory
~/whipradio/whipradio # Or a full path can be specified
#+end_src

Use the arrow keys to go up or down to the station you want to hear, then hit Enter.

To quit, hit Tab to move to ~OK~, then Tab (or right-arrow) to ~Cancel~, then hit Enter.

* Adding a station

Edit ~stations.txt~ and add a line with three parts separated by pipes:

~name|url|description~
