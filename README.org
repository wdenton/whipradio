Little shell script that streams internet radio stations I like.

[[file:whipradio-screenshot.png]]

* Requirements

+ ~git~ (to get the code)
+ ~mpv~ (to play the stream)
+ ~whiptail~ (to do the dialog box)

* Installation

This command will download all the files without requiring a GitHub account:

#+begin_src shell
git clone https://github.com/wdenton/whipradio.git
#+end_src

* Usage

Run the script on its own:

#+begin_src shell
cd whipradio
./whipradio
#+end_src

* Bugs

Not a bug, but a needed code improvement.  The script defines an associative array in a Bash script, where the keys are the station names and the values are the stream URLs.  I can't figure out how to pass the station names to ~whiptail~ to make them appear in the menu list, so I have to hard-code them.  This means duplication, which I'd like to get rid of.  Suggestions welcome.
